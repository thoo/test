\maketitle

In this paper we will communicate a very important scientific result.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Theoretical background}

It's all in Griffiths.
asdfasdf asdfasdfsd f
\section{Experimental results}

Here we include several vector-based graphics plotting the data we
took, using well-coordinated colors that reproduce well in black and
whit.

\section{Discussion}

Our hypothesis was correct. Some said it couldn't be done, but we
proved all of them wrong.

\section{Materials and Methods}

We used a very expensive Helium-3 cryostat and fabricated samples
in-house using reactive ion etching. Chirped pulse pairs were
generated using a homebuilt pulse shaper using a spatial light
modulator (SLM).

\section{Conlusion}

We expect a call from Stockholm at any moment.
